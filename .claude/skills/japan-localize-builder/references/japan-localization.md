# Japan Localization Framework

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Market Fit Assessment
- Does the problem exist in Japan? (same pain point?)
- Is there already a Japanese competitor? (search Japanese app stores, Google JP)
- Market size in Japan for this category
- Cultural relevance (does the concept translate?)

### 2. Cultural Adaptation
- **UX/UI**: Japanese users prefer information-dense layouts, detailed specs, trust signals (company info, press mentions). Minimalist Western design often needs more detail.
- **Payment**: Credit cards, convenience store payment (コンビニ払い), PayPay, LINE Pay, bank transfer. Subscription fatigue is real — consider one-time purchase or freemium.
- **Trust**: Japanese users need more social proof. Reviews, media coverage, official certifications matter more.
- **Communication**: Formal vs casual tone depends on B2B vs B2C. Keigo (敬語) for business. LINE is the dominant messaging platform.
- **Privacy**: Japanese users are privacy-conscious. Clear data handling policies are essential.

### 3. Distribution Channels (Japan-specific)
- **LINE** — 95M+ users, LINE Official Account for business
- **Twitter/X** — Extremely popular in Japan (more than most countries)
- **Note.com** — Japanese Medium equivalent, great for content marketing
- **PR TIMES** — Press release distribution
- **App Store JP** — Localized ASO is critical
- **Qiita** — Developer community (if targeting devs)
- **Zenn** — Developer articles and books

### 4. Naming & Branding
- Katakana names work well for tech products
- Keep names short and easy to pronounce in Japanese
- Check if domain + social handles are available with JP variants
- Consider ○○くん、○○さん style friendly naming for B2C

### 5. Legal & Business
- Privacy policy in Japanese (個人情報保護方針)
- 特定商取引法 (Specified Commercial Transactions Act) compliance for e-commerce
- Consider K.K. (株式会社) or GK (合同会社) for credibility
- Consumption tax (消費税 10%) handling
- Invoice system (インボイス制度) compliance

### 6. Competitive Advantage Patterns
- **Speed to market**: First mover in JP for a proven overseas model
- **Better localization**: Not just translation — full cultural adaptation
- **Japan-specific features**: Integration with LINE, Japanese payment methods
- **Local support**: Japanese customer support is a huge differentiator
- **Community**: Building a Japanese community around the product
